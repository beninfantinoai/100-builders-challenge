    Given a user's initial goal, deadline, and method of measurement, generate three sequential, context-aware clarifying questions. For context:

    If the goal is related to 'Health & Fitness', such as 'I want to lose weight' with a deadline 'by the end of the year':
    - A question could be 'How much do you currently weigh and what is your target weight?'
    - Based on the answer, the next could be 'How much time per week will you dedicate to exercising?'
    - And, 'Are you considering hiring a personal trainer within a budget of $100 - $200 per month?'

    If the goal concerns 'Financial Security', like 'I want to save more money' in the next '6 months':
    - A question could be 'How much do you currently have in savings and what's your target amount?'
    - Depending on the reply, 'What expenses are you willing to cut down on or eliminate?'
    - Lastly, 'Do you plan to seek financial advice or use budgeting tools?'

    For 'Personal Development' goals such as 'I want to learn how to code' in '6 months':
    - A possible question is 'What specifically do you wish to create â€“ a website, mobile app, etc.?'
    - Depending on the reply, 'Which programming languages do you want to learn?'
    - Finally, 'How many hours a week are you planning to practise & study?'

    Now, given the user's goal, deadline, and measure, please provide three contextually relevant questions.
